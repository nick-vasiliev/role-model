# Role Model (Roll Modelling)

This repo contains some python code for modelling rolls of different dice.

I built this to model the odds of success for crafting using Kibble's crafting system for 5e.

Pretty much done playing with it, was just using it to see how possible it was to do certain Kibble checks.
